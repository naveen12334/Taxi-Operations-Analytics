*** Taxi Operations Analytics ***

** Project Description **
This is an end-to-end data analytics project built on Microsoft Fabric, leveraging New York State Taxi trip data to deliver actionable insights on urban mobility trends. The solution covers the entire data lifecycle â€” from ingestion to reporting:

Data Engineering: Ingest and orchestrate raw taxi trip data using Data Factory pipelines.

Data Integration: Combine multiple datasets, including trip records, fare details, and geolocation data, into a unified model.

Data Cleaning & Transformation: Apply Dataflows and transformation logic to standardize formats, remove inconsistencies, and enrich records.

Data Analysis: Identify patterns in ride frequency, fare pricing, and passenger behavior across time, seasons, and geographies.

Data Visualization: Build interactive dashboards and reports in Power BI to support decision-making for transportation planning and business operations.

This project not only demonstrates the power of Microsoft Fabric for large-scale data processing but also delivers a practical, real-world analytics use case with potential applications in urban planning, taxi fleet optimization, and policy-making.
